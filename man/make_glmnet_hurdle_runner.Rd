\description{
Fits penalized logistic regression models via glmnet::glmnet() on wide data
with binary outcome in_hurdle.
}
\details{
Tuning grid:
  - rhs_list (RHS varies slowest)
  - alpha_grid
  - lambda_grid (varies fastest)

Design matrix handling:
  - Assumes numeric predictors only (no factors upstream).
  - Uses model.matrix() and stores per-RHS terms + x_cols.
  - Aligns Xnew columns to training x_cols by name; missing cols filled with 0.
