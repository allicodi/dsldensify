\title{Print a summary of a dsldensify fit}
\usage{
\method{print}{dsldensify}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{"dsldensify"} returned by
\code{\link{dsldensify}}.}

\item{...}{Unused. Included for compatibility with the generic
\code{print()} function.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{x}.
}
\description{
Displays a concise, human-readable summary of a fitted
\code{"dsldensify"} object. The printed output includes the selected learner,
whether the winning model is hazard-based or direct, the chosen binning
configuration (if applicable), the cross-validated risk of the selected
model, and whether cross-validated and full-data fits are available for
prediction.
}
\details{
This method is intended for interactive inspection and debugging rather
than programmatic access. All printed information is also available
directly as components of the \code{"dsldensify"} object.
