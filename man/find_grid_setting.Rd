\title{Locate a selected grid setting within a list of selection outputs}
\usage{
find_grid_setting(select_out, grid_type, n_bins)
}
\arguments{
\item{select_out}{List of grid-setting objects produced by
\code{run_grid_setting()} and/or \code{run_direct_setting()}.}

\item{grid_type}{Character string identifying the grid type. Typical values
include \code{"equal_range"}, \code{"equal_mass"}, and \code{"direct"}.}

\item{n_bins}{Integer giving the number of bins for hazard-based grid settings.
Ignored when \code{grid_type == "direct"}.}
}
\value{
The grid-setting object from \code{select_out} matching the requested
  \code{grid_type} and \code{n_bins}.
}
\description{
Finds and returns the grid-setting object in \code{select_out} that matches a
given \code{grid_type} and (when applicable) \code{n_bins}. This helper is used
after model selection to recover the full grid-setting object corresponding to
the selected learner and tuning choice.

For direct density settings (\code{grid_type == "direct"}), any entry in
\code{select_out} with matching \code{grid_type} is returned and
\code{n_bins} is ignored. For hazard-based settings, the function requires an
exact match on both \code{grid_type} and \code{n_bins}.
}
\details{
Each grid-setting object in \code{select_out} is expected to include
\code{$grid_type} and, for hazard-based settings, \code{$n_bins}. The returned
object typically contains the fold-level outputs \code{$cv_out} and any
grid-specific metadata needed for refitting and prediction.
