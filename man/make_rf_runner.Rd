}
}
\description{
Constructs a **runner** (learner adapter) compatible with the
\code{run_grid_setting()} / \code{summarize_and_select()} workflow used in
\code{dsl_densify}. The runner fits probabilistic random forest models via
\code{ranger::ranger()} on long-format discrete-time hazard data
(binary outcome \code{in_bin}), and supports tuning over:
\itemize{
  \item multiple RHS feature specifications (\code{rhs_list}),
  \item node-size parameters (\code{min_node_size_grid}),
  \item optional feature-subset sizes (\code{mtry_grid}),
  \item sampling behavior (bootstrap vs subsampling).
}

The fitted models estimate per-bin discrete-time hazards
\eqn{P(T \in \text{bin}_j \mid T \ge \text{bin}_j, W)} using a probabilistic
classification forest (\code{probability = TRUE}), returning predicted
probabilities for \code{in_bin = 1}.
}
\details{
## Data requirements
The runner expects \code{train_set} and \code{newdata} as \code{data.table}s
in the **long hazard format** produced by \code{format_long_hazards()},
including:
\itemize{
  \item a binary outcome column \code{outcome_col} (default \code{in_bin}),
  \item a time-bin column \code{bin_id_col} (default \code{bin_id}),
  \item covariates referenced in \code{rhs_list},
  \item an optional weight column \code{weights_col} (default \code{wts}).
}

Internally, the runner fits a probabilistic classification forest by
constructing a data.frame containing \code{outcome_col} and the selected
feature columns, and fitting \code{outcome_col ~ .}. If the outcome is numeric
or integer, it is coerced to a factor with levels \code{c(0, 1)} to ensure
probability predictions are returned in a consistent format.

## Prediction
\code{predict()} returns the predicted probability for class \code{"1"} from
\code{ranger} (i.e., \code{P(in_bin = 1)}). Predictions are returned as an
\code{n_long x K} numeric matrix aligned with the tuning grid. Column names
are set to the corresponding \code{.tune} values.

## Model selection
Each tuning row corresponds to a single fitted forest, so no \code{select_fit()}
method is required.
}
\section{RHS specifications (column selection only)}{

The \code{rhs_list} argument is used to define a feature set by extracting
variable names from each RHS specification:
\itemize{
  \item RHS may be provided as one-sided formulas (e.g., \code{~ W1 + W2}),
        or as character strings (e.g., \code{"W1 + W2"}).
  \item Each RHS is converted to a formula internally and variable names are
        extracted via \code{all.vars()}.
  \item The runner does not evaluate transformations; it assumes the referenced
        columns already exist in the long hazard data.
}

By default, \code{bin_id_col} is enforced as part of the feature set; if it is
missing from an RHS specification, it is appended automatically.
}

\section{Tuning grid and prediction layout}{

The internal \code{tune_grid} is ordered such that:
\itemize{
  \item RHS varies first,
  \item then \code{min_node_size},
  \item then sampling behavior (\code{sampling}, \code{replace}, \code{sample_fraction}),
  \item and optionally \code{mtry} (if \code{mtry_grid} is supplied).
}

Each row of \code{tune_grid} corresponds to **exactly one fitted forest**.
During cross-validation, \code{predict()} returns an \code{n_long x K} matrix
of predicted hazards, where \code{K = nrow(tune_grid)}, with columns aligned
to \code{.tune}.
}

\section{Sampling as a tuning dimension}{

The runner supports a sampling scheme tuning dimension via \code{sampling_grid}:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"bootstrap"} uses sampling with replacement
        (\code{replace = TRUE}, \code{sample.fraction = 1.0}).
  \item \code{"subsample"} uses sampling without replacement
        (\code{replace = FALSE}) with fractions provided in
        \code{subsample_fraction_grid}.
}

This allows direct comparison of bootstrap forests and subsampled forests
under the same runner interface.
}

\section{Weights}{

If \code{use_weights_col = TRUE}, observation weights are passed to
\code{ranger::ranger()} via \code{case.weights}. The weight column defaults
to \code{wts}. If \code{use_weights_col = TRUE} and \code{weights_col} is
missing, fitting will error.
}

\section{Deterministic seeding}{

If \code{seed} is provided, a tune-specific seed is used for each fit by
setting \code{set.seed(seed + .tune)}. This yields deterministic fitting
behavior across runs while keeping different tuning rows distinct.
